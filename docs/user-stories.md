### User Stories

1. **User registration**
   - As a new user, I want to create an account by entering my email address and choosing a password. When I visit the login page, I should see a clear option to create a new account. I want the system to guide me through the process so I understand what is required. When I enter my email, the system checks if it contains an '@' character and is at least 2 characters long. After I submit the information, I would like to receive an email with a one-time code that I need to enter to activate my account. It is important to me that my password is stored securely so I can feel confident that my information is protected.

2. **User login**
   - As a registered user, I want to log in to my account with my email and password. When I visit the login page, I want to see a simple and user-friendly interface where I can enter my credentials. When I click “Sign in,” the system needs to validate my information. If I enter incorrect information, I would like to see a clear error message so I can try again. When I log in, I would like a caching feature so I don't have to re-enter my information unless I log out or switch devices.


3. **Navigation in the Emotion panel**
   - As a user, I would like to see a grid of emotion cards when I log in so I can explore different emotions. Each card should have an appealing image and a short title describing the emotion. I want the cards to be clickable so that when I select a card, I'm taken to a detailed Q&A page where I can learn more about the specific emotion. It should be possible to scroll through the panel to see all the cards, and I want to be able to search or filter the cards by category so I can find the emotion I'm interested in.

4. **Q&A Interaction**
   - As a user, I want to select an emotion card and then answer related questions so I can reflect on my emotions. When on the Q&A page, I want to see a description of the selected emotion, followed by questions that encourage me to think about how that emotion affects me. I also want an option to choose how I would like to feel instead from a list of predefined choices. When I answer the questions, I want my answers to be automatically saved in my journal so I can return to them later and see how my feelings have changed over time.

5. **Access to Journal**
   - As a user, I want to have access to my journal where I can view and review my previous posts. I would like the journal to be organized in a way that I can easily find specific posts based on date or emotion. When I open my journal, I want to see a list of all my saved posts and I want to be able to click on each post to read the details. It's important for me to be able to reflect on how my responses and feelings have evolved so I can gain insight into my personal growth.

6. **Push notifications**
   - As a user, I want to be able to enable push notifications so I can receive reminders about my development and progress. When I navigate to the settings, I would like to see a clear option to enable or disable notifications. I also want information about what kind of reminders I want to receive so I know what to expect. When I enable the notifications, the system should send me updates every four days to remind me of my goals and encourage me to reflect on my progress.
